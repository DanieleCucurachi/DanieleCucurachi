ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @DanieleCucurachi 

I am a computational physicist, recently graduated from the MSc in Applied Physics programme at **EPFL** in Switzerland. My background and research interests span a wide range of exciting problems ranging from machine learning to quantum computing (you can find more on my [website](https://danielecucurachi.github.io/personal-website/)). Currently, I am working on a research project in collaboration with the *Quantum Information Group* at the **University of Cambridge**.

On the side, I collaborate as an AdVenture Partner with **Scientifica VC**, a venture capital firm specializing in deep-tech start-ups.

Feel free to reach out!
