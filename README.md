üëã Hello, I‚Äôm @DanieleCucurachi 

I am a computational physicist with experience in scientific software development and research. My background and research interests span a wide range of exciting problems ranging from machine learning to quantum computing. Currently, I am investigating quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) trainability at [**Pasqal**](https://github.com/pasqal-io). 

During my previous internship at [**IQM Quantum Computers**](https://github.com/iqm-finland), among other projects that I cannot showcase, I made relevant contributions to [KQCircuits](https://github.com/iqm-finland/KQCircuits), an open-source Python library for integrated quantum circuit design. My contributions can be found [here](https://github.com/iqm-finland/KQCircuits/commits?author=danielecucurachiiqm).

On the side:

- I collaborate as an AdVenture Partner with [**Scientifica VC**](https://scientifica.vc/en/), a venture capital firm specializing in deep-tech startups. I am responsible for identifying innovative technological projects within universities and research departments, fostering potential investments by Scientifica. Feel free to reach out at [daniele.cucurachi@scientificavp.it](mailto:daniele.cucurachi@scientificavp.it) to discuss interesting projects or ideas.

- I am working on a commentary‚Äëtype article for [**UIS (United Italian Societies) Research Centre**](https://uniteditaliansocieties.com/uis-research-centre/), under the supervision of Dr. Enrico Fontana, about key investment trends and recent socio-economic shifts in the evolving quantum industry, as well as the role of quantum technology in global geopolitics. The preliminary results of the research project have been presented at the [**‚ÄùOsservatorio sulle Metamorfosi Socio‚ÄëTecnologiche‚Äù**](https://iiclondra.esteri.it/it/gli_eventi/calendario/osservatorio-sulle-metamorfosi-socio-tecnologiche/) event, hosted by United Italian Societies (UIS) at the Italian Cultural Institute (ICI) in London.

- I am finalizing a [research project](https://danielecucurachi.github.io/personal-website/project/qmcmc/) in collaboration with the [**Quantum Information Group**](https://www.qi.phy.cam.ac.uk/) (University of Cambridge).
