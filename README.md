ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @DanieleCucurachi 

I am a computational physicist with experience in scientific software development and research. My background and research interests span a wide range of exciting problems ranging from machine learning to quantum computing (you can find more on my [website](https://danielecucurachi.github.io/personal-website/)). Currently, I am investigating Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) trainability at [**Pasqal**](https://github.com/pasqal-io). During my previous internship at [**IQM Quantum Computers**](https://github.com/iqm-finland), among other projects that I cannot showcase, I made relevant contributions to [KQCircuits](https://github.com/iqm-finland/KQCircuits), an open-source Python library for integrated quantum circuit design. My contributions can be found [here](https://github.com/iqm-finland/KQCircuits/commits?author=danielecucurachiiqm).

On the side:

- I collaborate as an AdVenture Partner with **Scientifica VC**, a venture capital firm specializing in deep-tech startups. I am responsible for identifying innovative technological projects within universities and research departments, fostering potential investments by Scientifica. Feel free to reach out at [daniele.cucurachi@scientificavp.it](mailto:daniele.cucurachi@scientificavp.it) to discuss interesting projects or ideas.

- I am working on a commentaryâ€‘type article for **UIS (United Italian Societies) Research Centre**, under the supervision of Dr. Enrico Fontana, about the recent downturn in venture capital investments in deep-tech and quantum startups.

- I am finalizing a [research project](https://danielecucurachi.github.io/personal-website/project/qmcmc/) in collaboration with the [**Quantum Information Group**](https://www.qi.phy.cam.ac.uk/) (University of Cambridge).
